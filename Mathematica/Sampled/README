Code for sampling scattering from various geometric structures.

DebyeSampler is a class to sample <sin(q |Ri-Rj|)>/(q |Ri-Rj|) for Ri Rj sampled for different
geometric structures.

GenerateSamples produces randomly sampled 3D vectors from various distributions.

Sample_* uses these to sample from specific geometries.
