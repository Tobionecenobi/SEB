Mathematica notebooks

Here we store the derivation of the various scattering expressions

RWpolymer.nb            Gaussian polymers
SolidCyllinder.nb       SolidCyllinder
SolidSphere.nb          SolidSphere

Sampled:                Sampled scattering.

To check the Mathematica derivations, we generate sampled scattering curves using the Debye formula
for pairs of geometric points sampled on the structures. Code + output is in sampled.
