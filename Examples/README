Examples

Chain_Rod_end-to-end.cpp    Polymer build by end-to-end linking N rods
Dendrimer.cpp               Builds dendritic structures (explained in the SEB paper)
DiBlockStarChain.cpp        Builds chain of five 4-functional diblock copolymer stars (explained in SEB paper)
Evaluating.cpp              Example of how to evaluate scattering expressions.
Evaluating2.cpp             More complicated example of how to evaluate scattering expressions
Exceptions.cpp              How to catch and handle SEB exceptions.
Micelle.cpp                 N polymers added to a spherical core.
Output.cpp                  Examples of outputting in different formats (C++, python, default, latex)
Output2.cpp                 Using to_string_format(..) to convert ginac expressions to strings.
RandomLinearPolymer.cpp     Random polymer chain, where the 2nd polymer is randomly attached along the first, the 3rd randomly on the 2nd and so on.
Star.cpp                    Creates a star structure by adding N polymers to a central invisible point.
SymbolInterface.cpp         Example of how to interface with SEBs symbol interface to GiNaC.
TriBlockCopolymer.cpp       Generates an ABC block-copolymer
TriBlockSymbolic.cpp        Example of how to use symbolic sub-units to generate a tri-block structure. Symbolic sub-units can not be evaluated to numbers.
Validation_*.cpp            These are all examples of how we validate scattering expressions in sub-units.
