Validation

To validate the scattering expressions, we have used matematica to generate tables with scattering curves, which are
compared to the implemented terms. 

The Validate_*.cpp scripts instantiate a sub-unit and then use 



s->ValidateDefinedTerms();

to check that all expected amplitude and phase factor expressions are defined.


s->ValidateFormFactorFile(map, "F.dat");
s->ValidateFormFactorAmplitudeFile("center",map, dir+"A_center2shell.dat");
s->ValidatePhaseFactorFile("center","surface",map, dir+"Pcenter_surface.dat");
:

to check the implemented expressions vs. the data generated by mathematica.

The Guinier expansions are also compared against the data generated by mathematica,
by comparing 1- sigma R^2 q^2/6 to the data generated by mathematica, where sigma R^2
expressions are hardcoded for the sub-unit. This comparison is only made where the second
order term is <0.01 of the first order term.



Some expressions can be Taylor expanded directly, if they are sufficiently simple
and does not involve special functions.

s->ValidateSymbolically();

Does this and checks that the expansion is of the form     1 - q^2 <something> / 6
where <something> should match the hardcoded terms.
