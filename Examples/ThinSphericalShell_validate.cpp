      Use the Validate method to check sub-units in particular
      
          * All terms are defined for the set of reference points.
               * That is one form factor amplitude for each reference point.
               * A phase factor[r1][r2] is defined for each pair r1<r2 reference points.
               * For r1=r2 reference point pairs, phase factors should be defined for
                 distributed reference points, and NOT for specific reference point pairs.
                 
          * Normalization of all scattering terms. We assume F,A,Psi -> 1 for q->0
          * Guinier expansions should have a zero q term.
          * RgÂ²  should match the Guinier expansion of the form factor = 1 - q^2 <Rg^2>/3
          * sigma <R^2> should match the Guinier expansions of form factor amplitudes
            and phase factors as 1 - q^2 sigma<R^2> / 6.

      Here we validate the expressions for the RWpolymer sub-unit which has a mathematically
      well behaved Guinier expansions, but for some of the special functions GiNaC is unable
      to automagically derive the series expansion, this typically occurs when one has to
      take the q->0 limit carefully since the expansion has divergent terms that cancel when
      taking the limit. GiNaC can't take limits, but just inserts q=0 and throws a
      division by zero exception.
      
      A work around for this behaviour is to temporarily replace the special functions by a
      series expansion approximation. This is done with the compile flag -DSPECIALFUNCTIONSERIES
      which allows the expressions for Rods and RWloops to be validated as well.
