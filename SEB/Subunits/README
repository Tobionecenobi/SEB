This is where the individual sub-units are implemented.

To add a new sub-unit do:

   1) copy one of the existing sub-unit .hpp files to mysubunit.hpp and implement your scattering expressions there.

   2) write  stype = MYSUBUNIT  in the constructor and add MYSUBUNIT to enum in constant.hpp

   3) add mysubunit.hpp to Subunits.hpp

   4) add a line 
 
       else if (subtype == "MySubunit")         return new MySubunit();
 
      to CreateSubunit.hpp 
   
   
and do make seb in the root to recompile the library.


NB we strongly advise testing all scattering expression e.g. against numerically sampled distances
to validate that the expressions are correct. See e.g. our ~seb/Validation folder.
